# CodestiNation_online_judge
This is a very basic php only project which attempts to replicate an online judge locally on your computer. Only php and basic HTML is used. This project is under development and needs help on frontend.
# What is a judge
A judge or online judge is a website on which you can solve many coding problems, code your solution, submit it and the website compiles and runs your code against some predefined test cases and stores the ouput. This output is then checked against the expected output and verdit is returned to you ie right or wrong answere.
# CodestiNation
This is my attempt to create a very basic judge system that runs locally (atm). The only language permitted is C++ (more languges will be added). You can upload you '.cpp' file or code in our Editor (needs work). 
# How to use 
This is pretty simple to use! All you need to do is install WAMP server (LAMP for Linux and MAMP for Mac OS). Just download the server and it will install automatically. After installing a folder will be created c://wamp/www or c://wamp64/www (for windows and Linux), In this 'www' folder just paste the 'CodestiNation' folder.Lastly run the WAMP server and go to http://localhost/CodestiNation/main.php on your browser. :)
# Need help
This project needs a lot of work. You can contribute in many ways - help to make the frontend, add more problems optimize the site etc.
Help is much appreciated :)
